<br class="indent">This is a very credible source because it is a primary source of how post Tokugawa Japan dealt with other countries. It shows the extent to which it was isolated and how cataclysmic it was of a change as Japan began trading and interacting more with outside countries. This map perfectly shows the little information Japan had and this is important because it is possible reason they reacted so dramatically in both World Wars especially World War 2.</br></p></br>

<br><p>Frederick R. Dickinson, “War and National Reinvention: Japan in the Great War, 1914-1919. <br>This photograph shows the lengths Japan went in order to strengthen its military. This picture depicts many soldiers riled up into one location in order to prove Japan’s military might. As seen in very “nationalistic” countries like the United States of America they tend to focus a lot of money and effort in flaunting their military prowess.

<br>Japan had realized and felt the destructive capabilities of the nuclear bomb. Due to a rational move by the minister of foreign affairs Japan decided to surrender to the UNited States. The bombs were able to neutralize a lot of the effects and emotions brought about by Japan's Imperialism. Japan subsequently had to deal with a lot of emotional and physical effects of the nuclear bomb.</br></p></br>

<br>An article published by The Japan Times, Japan’s longest running english newspaper.  It

<br>This act of aggression by Japan created one of its largest downfalls during World War 2. The United States during that time period had chosen to effectively stay neutral but this event not only set into motion the prompt joining of the United States into the allied forces but it subsequently gave the United States a reason and location to test out the weapons that it had just made.

<br>This book is published by a world renowned college. This book helped give us a greater understanding of how Japan's feelings toward the west and its need to “modernize” has impacted the way many japanese think what is an ideal in their culture.

It especially talks about the major change in its economy before world war 2 this can be used to extrapolate that it was due to these changes that Japan entered world war 2.
