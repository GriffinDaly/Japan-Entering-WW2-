[1] Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters decided by open discussion.

[2] All classes, high and low, shall be united in vigorously carrying out the administration of affairs of state.

[3] The common people, no less than the civil and military officials, shall all be allowed to pursue their own calling so that there may be no discontent.

[4] Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of Nature.

[5] Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundation of imperial rule."

A trend throughout these principles is a strong feeling of Nationalism or Patriotism. The first principle states that the government and nation should be put above all else. The fifth principle follows a similar vein in that its fundamental purpose is to make the Emperor and by extension the Nation more powerful.</br><br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br> </p>
