Prior to the opening, Dejima had been the only city through which outside traders, specifically those from portugal, could enter and trade with Japan. As a result the city had been rich and populous. However, after the whole country was opened up it lost its unique quality and was quickly overshadowed by more convinient or lucrative trade sites. The country was originally closed due to a heaby xenophobic climate within the government and culture, partially stemming from a feeling of cultural superiority. </br><br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br> </p>
